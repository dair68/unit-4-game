A brain-tickling crystal number guessing game! 

The goal is to get your score to match a certain number by clicking on crystals
which each grant a certain amount of points. The catch is that the crystals give
different number of points between games. Click the crystals to learn their values,
and figure out the winning combination of clicks!
